<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
For CSCE 315, our group came up with a web collage application that access various APIs:

* TripAdvisor
* Unsplash
* Yelp

TravelLab focuses on color-blind and dyslexia accessibility. In order to achieve so, TravelLab uses a color-blind friendly color palette and [dyslexie Font](https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/).

TravelLab provides a convenient way for users to explore cities or areas that they are interested in travelling to or interested in exploring virtually. By providing information from a variety of sources, our application will make travel planning faster and more user friendly.

![Travel Lab Results][results-screenshot]

With a single search for a location, the user will be able to view photos, find attractions and restaurants in the area, and view hotel accommodations with reviews and ratings.

![Travel Lab Restaurants][restaurants-screenshot]
![Travel Lab Hotels][hotels-screenshot]

Rather than obtaining this information from various different sites, our application will reduce this need and curate the top suggestions for the user. Providing all of this information through our application will ease the process of travel planning in addition to also allowing users to simply explore new places virtually.
